Current Submission:
1.	Andrew Deployed the contract, started at .25sEth

https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x2e9da65b58b339ec7df2f9a16ed985d0afd15559253546969c4c42599a243aff


2.	Andrew Clicked HelloWorld, had 0.2491sEth from deploy and was at no cost to click HelloWorld

3.	Andrew Clicked SetText, with "this is my text that is going to go over the limit for array elements to show" some had .2491 Seth, now have .2490

https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xe0b242cbfb238eed6fd3e127a0afcc50ccd2490290d095ba8b4254f918671211

4.	Adrian used the “Connect Wallet” from the environment tab dropdown, then added the contract address to the "At Address" button within the Deploy and Transact. Adrian then clicked the HelloWorld button and saw Andrew's previously set, “Set Text” of “…this is my text”.

5.	Adrian starts at .9093 sEth, and clicked SetText. Adrian received a Gas Estimation failed error highlighting Adrian was not currently the owner. Adrian Clicked to send the transaction and again, MetaMask warned that the transaction was likely to fail; which it did.

6.	Andrew changes ownership using the failed from address within the previous transaction to set Adrian as the owner

7.	 With Adrian as the owner, when Adrian clicked SetText he was able to change the text to “Adrian is the the owner”

8.	When clicking “HelloWolrd” Adrian and Andrew both see the changed text of “Adrian is the owner”

9.	With Adrian as the owner, Andrew now tried to set text to “Andrew is now the owner”, received exact same messaging from both Remix and MetaMask that the transaction was likely to fail; which it subsequently did.

10. Shijin accessed contract at 0x089d2927a6ae42fc657cdfd9fc681e9c31d55d42 and saw the message set by Adrian ("Adrian is the owner of this contract")

11. Shijin called the setText field and received an error (only owner) 

https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x2038400f08fe62e50e7272675d44dc69aca24afa4ff8c0062c98f8a6a8fd0b25

12. Adrian transferred ownership to Shijin.

13. Shijin setText to "Shijin is the owner".

14. Kevin accessed Remix, navigating to “Deploy & Run Transactions”
    
15. Connected his Metamask Account (`0x4B69582aFf15fee68c0f633d17F14D09aDf8deB2`) with Remix
    
16. Then added the Contract that Adrian had deployed (`0x089d2927a6ae42fc657cdfd9fc681e9c31d55d42`) to “At Address” to load the contract
    
17. Starting with 0.25 sETH, the first function Kevin interacted with was the helloWorld function which returned the string: “Shijin is the owner.”
    
18. When clicking on the “owner” button within the Remix UI, the following address is shown as the current contract owner: `0xd1B41bE30F980315b8A6b754754aAa299C7abea2`
    
19. When Kevin adds a string of “Kevin wants to be the owner” and clicks on the “setText” button, there is a modal pop-up within Remix that provides a message that the transaction will likely fail. After going ahead and forcing the transaction anyways, it was noted that the transaction has failed because the “Caller is not the owner”

20. Similarly, when attempting to change the ownership from the current contract owner to Kevin’s account via the Transfer Ownership function, a similar behaviour and return message was displayed, as was in the previous step.

21. The current owner Adrian, has set Kevin to be the owner. Confirmed this has changed when clicking on the "owner" button and viewing the account address displayed.

22. Using the setText function, the text was updated to "Kevin is the owner." A nominal amount of gas was consumed for this transaction (0.000044877 ETH).
